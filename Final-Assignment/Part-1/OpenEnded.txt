1. A loop is when you want to do the same thing many times. It's like when you want to count to 10, but you 
don't want to say each number one at a time. You can use loop to do it much faster.

2. Console.log allows you to see what's happening in your program, like if you want to see what a variable is
or if function is working. For return, it is something that you use to give something back. In programming, 
use return when you want to give back value from a function

3. Thruthy values are thing that are considered true, even if they're not the word "true". For example, the
number 1 is truthy because it means there's something there, while 0's is falsy because there's nothing there.

4. The internet is like a big highway that connects people all around the world. Just like how you need a 
road to go to the park or the grocery store, you need the internet to go to websites or watch videos online.
When you type in a website's name, like www.google.com, your computer sends a message to a big computer 
called a server, which is like the master of all the websites.

5. A website is like a magic book that tells your computer what to show you. The book is made up of many 
different pages, and each page has its own special job. Some pages are like the cover of the book, which 
is called the HTML file. It tells your computer what the website should look like and what other pages to 
show you. Other pages are like the drawings or pictures in the book, which are called CSS files. They make 
the website look pretty by adding colors and shapes. And finally, there are pages that tell the website how 
to do special things, like playing a video or letting you send a message, which are called JavaScript files.
